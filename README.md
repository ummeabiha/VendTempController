# ABOUT VENDTEMPCONTROLLER
The primary objective of this system is to maintain the temperature within the critical range of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, ensuring optimal 
storage conditions for pharmaceutical items in a vending machine. 

## SCOPE OF VENDTEMPCONTROLLER
The scope of the Pharmacy Vending Machine Temperature Controller encompasses the development, 
implementation, and operation of a robust temperature control system for vending machines specifically 
designed for pharmaceutical storage. The primary focus is on maintaining the temperature within the critical 
range of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius to ensure the integrity and stability of pharmaceutical products. The scope 
includes the following key elements: 
### Temperature Control: 
The system will actively control the internal temperature of the pharmacy vending machine, 
utilizing precision mechanisms to maintain it within the specified range of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. 
### Temperature Monitoring: 
Continuous monitoring of the vending machine's internal temperature will be performed in realtime. The system will provide accurate and up-to-date temperature data to operators and relevant 
personnel. 
### Alarm Mechanism: 
An alarm system will be implemented to promptly detect temperature deviations beyond the critical 
range. If the temperature falls below 2 degrees Celsius or exceeds 8 degrees Celsius, the system 
will trigger an immediate alarm. The alarm will serve as an alert to operators or maintenance 
personnel, indicating the need for timely intervention to prevent potential damage to 
pharmaceutical items.
